# Intro

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Hi, I&apos;m Yan Min. I am currently pursuing a master&apos;s degree in <a href="https://www.eng.mcmaster.ca/ece/">ECE at McMaster</a>.
Alongside my studies, I am doing a research internship at <a href="https://noahlab.com.hk/#/home">Huawei Noah&apos;s Ark Lab</a>.
My research interests lie in machine learning and computer vision,
with a recent focus on 3D gaussian splatting (3DGS).<br><br>
I will graduate in either April or August next year.
I am open to co-op opportunities starting in January 2025
and full-time positions starting in May 2025.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any opportunities.
